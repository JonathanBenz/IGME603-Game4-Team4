# Outback Ciphers

Outback Ciphers is a cryptography game using substitution ciphers "sponsored" by Outback Steakhouse (not actually), where the player completes phrases and ciphers to earn more money. If the player runs out of money, they lose. Players can acquire hints and letters for the cipher by spending money on kangaroos and bloominâ€™ onions.
